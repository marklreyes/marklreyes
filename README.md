👋, I'm Mark Reyes!

## About Me 👨🏾‍💻
Described by past teammates as a ***quick study*** I'm a frontend web engineer that's in depth with the presentation layer of your web experience. I’m also a [podcaster](https://www.marklreyes.com/allwebsd-podcast/) and [blogger](https://www.marklreyes.com/category/project-log/) who enjoys sharing my experiences and knowledge with others.
